# timeseries_mc

A Monte Carlo simulation package for time series data.

## Description

`timeseries_mc` is a Python package that allows users to simulate future paths of a time series using the Monte Carlo method. It's designed to be easy to use while providing accurate simulations based on historical data.

## Installation

Using pip:

```
pip install timeseries_mc
```

Using conda (if you have a Conda package):

```
conda install -c <your-channel> timeseries_mc
```

## Usage

Here's a basic example:

```python
from timeseries_mc import simulate

# Sample time series data
data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Simulate future paths
simulated_paths = simulate(data, n_simulations=1000)
```

## Testing

After installation, you can run tests (if provided in your package) to ensure everything is working as expected:

```
pytest
```
